I saw my math teacher with a piece of graph paper yesterday. I think he must be plotting something. /What did the triangle say to the circle? “You’re pointless.” /How does a mathematician plow fields? With a pro-tractor. /What’s a math teacher’s favorite kind of tree? Geometry. /Parallel lines have so much in common … It’s a shame they’ll never meet. /What do you call more than one L? A parallel! /Why wasn’t the geometry teacher at school? Because she sprained her angle. /I had an argument with a 90° angle. It turns out it was right. /Did you hear about the over-educated circle? It has 360°! /What shape is usually waiting for you inside a Starbucks? A line. /Why doesn’t anybody talk to circles? Because there’s no point. /Why was the obtuse triangle always upset? Because it’s never right. /What do geometry teachers have decorating their floor? Area rugs! /What do mathematicians do after a snowstorm? Make snow angles!/Why did the mathematician spill all of his food in the oven? The directions said, “Put it in the oven at 180°”./Why was math class so long? The teacher kept going off on a tangent.
